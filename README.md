FL2K_2 : a fork of the osmo_fl2K project.

Turns FL2000-based USB 3.0 to VGA adapters into low cost DACs.

For more information on sorce see https://osmocom.org/projects/osmo-fl2k/wiki

This project fork is primarily for use with playing TBC files the following is for that use case.
but it can also be used as a remplacement of the osmos-fl2K thanks to all the new QOL feature added.


# FL2K TBC Player


A Simple TBC playback utility, currently only CLI (Command Line Interface)

This will later be both GUI/CLI.


## What is a TBC?


Its a digital Time Base Corrected lossless 16-bit video file thats in 1 file for Composite streams and 2 files for S-Video streams.

## How do I get a TBC file?

Via [VHS-Decode](https://github.com/oyvindln/vhs-decode) (Tape Decoding) and [LD-Decode](https://github.com/happycube/ld-decode) (LaserDisk Decoding) or [CVBS-Decode](https://github.com/oyvindln/vhs-decode/wiki/CVBS-Composite-Decode) (Composite Decoding)

### You can also genarate an TBC file from normal video using [ld-chroma-encoder](https://github.com/happycube/ld-decode/wiki/ld-chroma-encoder)

# Setup


## Standardised Cable Config

### Composite

Red - Right Audio

Blue - Left Audio

Green - Composite Video

### S-Video

Green - Lumanace Y

Blue - Chroma C

Red - Mono/Mono Mix Audio

## Windows

Download and install the stock driver [FL2000 Stock Driver](https://github.com/vrunk11/fl2k_2/fl2k_2/resources/FL2000-Driver-2.1.33676.0.exe)

Then select and replace the driver with libusb-win32 (v1.2.6.0) using [Zagig Driver Tool](https://github.com/vrunk11/fl2k_2/fl2k_2/resources/zadig-2.7.exe)

Simply download the latest [Windows Release](https://github.com/vrunk11/fl2k_2/releases).

Decompress the .zip file.

For GUI users

Open the fl2k_2.bat file.

For CLI users

Open an CMD Window and then open the directory your files are in, copy the path and add cd to the start example:

    cd C:\Users\harry\Desktop\fl2k

Once inside use arguments as stated below example:

    fl2k-2.exe -u -s pal -G16 -tbcG -G example.tbc


## Linux


### Download Dependencies

    sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev libsoxr-dev libsoxr0 libsoxr-lsr0

### Install the libusb and soxr headers if not already present

    git clone https://gitea.osmocom.org/sdr/osmo-fl2k
    mkdir osmo-fl2k/build
    cd osmo-fl2k/build

## Build with CMAKE 

    cmake ../ -DINSTALL_UDEV_RULES=ON
    make -j 3
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig

Before being able to use the device as a non-root user, the udev rules need to be reloaded:

`sudo udevadm control -R`

&

`sudo udevadm trigger`

### Download The Player

    git clone https://github.com/vrunk11/fl2k_2.git fl2k-tbc-player

## Add soxr.h

Copy soxr.h in `include` folder can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/chirlu/soxr/tree/master/src/soxr.h)

To enter into the install directory use CD

    cd fl2k-tbc-player

Compile the player with:

    sudo ./compile.sh

Run the software with:

    fl2k_file2

This will output the help commandlist if not given an argument. 

## MacOS


Support yet to be Implimented.


# Usage


As its an VGA R-G-B adapter so there is 3 ADC's

To play a file on an ADC channel you do -R for red -G for green and -B for blue

For the Samplerate/TV System you can do `-s ntsc` or `-s pal`

Currently to make tbc playback possible you need to do the 16 to 8 bit conversion with:

`-R16` for red `-G16` for green `-B16` for blue

Also needed is removal of the extra line on each frame:

`-tbcR` for red `-tbcG` for green `-tbcB` for blue


## Standard Oprational Commands


For windows just use fl2k_2.exe


### Composite output on the red channel:


Linux:

`fl2k_file2 -u -s ntsc -G16 -tbcG -G example.tbc`

Windows:

`fl2k_2.exe -u -s ntsc -G16 -tbcG -G example.tbc`

### S-Video output with Luma on the green channel and Chroma on the blue channel:

Linux:

`fl2k_file2 -u -s pal -G16 -tbcG -G example.tbc -B16 -tbcB -B example_chroma.tbc`

Windows:

`fl2k_2.exe -u -s pal -G16 -tbcG -G example.tbc -B16 -tbcB -B example_chroma.tbc`


# Commandlist


`-d` device_index (default: 0)

`-readMode` (default = 0) option : 0 = multit-threading (RGB) / 1 = hybrid (R --> GB) / 2 = hybrid (RG --> B) / 3 = sequential (R -> G -> B)

`-s` samplerate (default: 100 MS/s) allows you to change TV System `-s ntsc` or `-s pal`

`-u` Set sample type to unsigned

`-R` filename (use '-' to read from stdin)

`-G` filename (use '-' to read from stdin)

`-B` filename (use '-' to read from stdin)

`-R16` (convert bits 16 to 8)

`-G16` (convert bits 16 to 8)

`-B16` (convert bits 16 to 8)

`-tbcR` interpret R as tbc file

`-tbcG` interpret G as tbc file

`-tbcB` interpret B as tbc file

`-CgainR` Control Chroma Gain Level (using color burst)

`-CgainG` Control Chroma Gain Level (using color burst)

`-CgainB` Control Chroma Gain Level (using color burst)

`-resample` resample the input to the correct output frequency (can fix color decoding on PAL signal)


## Possible USB Issues


You might see this in Linux:

    Allocating 6 zero-copy buffers
    libusb: error [op_dev_mem_alloc] alloc dev mem failed errno 12
    Failed to allocate zero-copy buffer for transfer 4

If so then you can then increase your allowed usbfs buffer size with the following command:

`echo 0 > /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/usbfs_memory_mb`

Falling back to buffers in userspace
Requested sample rate 14318181 not possible, using 14318170.000000, error is -11.000000

When the end of the file is reached you will see in CLI:

(RED) : Nothing more to read

Also, to enable USB zerocopy for better I/O stability and reduced CPU usage:

`echo 0 > /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/usbfs_memory_mb`

And reboot. This was added to the kernel [back in 2014](https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/7/2/377). The default buffer size is 16.
